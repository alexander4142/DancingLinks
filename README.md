# Dancing Links in C++
C++ implementation of the Dancing links algorithm, also known as Knuth's algorithm X, discovered by Donald Knuth.

Solves the exact cover problem in the form of a sparse matrix where the first line is the number of columns, see example.txt.

Note: Run time is proportional to the number of solutions, so the program struggles to solve relatively small matrices if the number of solutions is very large.
